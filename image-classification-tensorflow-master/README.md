# Image Classification - Tensorflow & Keras

Image Classification powered by Tensorflow and Keras.

<br />

## About This Experiment

This experiment is about a basic task in computer vision, that is, image recognition. The NumPy and TensorFlow frameworks are required. <br>
The NumPy arrays are used as the image objects. Meanwhile deep learning algorithms and convolutional neural network (CNN) are powered by The TensorFlow framework. 
This experiment recognizes image categories based on the CIFAR10 dataset.
